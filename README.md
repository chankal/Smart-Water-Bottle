Proper hydration is important for many bodily functions and prevents dehydration which can lead to further complications. My smart bottle attachment can attach to any bottle and track hydration levels by keeping track of how often you drink water and how much water you drink. The user will be able to view this information on a web dashboard and tft display to clearly view their trends. Many people tend to forget about drinking water as it gets pushed to the back of their mind. I hope this device will allow people to be more mindful of staying hydrated

I originally experimented with using capacitance to read water level but later pivoted to using a load cell for more reliable results.
